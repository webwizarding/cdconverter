# Youtube -> MP4 -> MP3 converter
---

I saw my friend take a really long time downloading youtube videos into mp3's to burn into a CD so this hopefully will speed up the proccess for others

---

# Prerequisites 

```
pip install mutagen
```
```
pip install pytube
```
```
pip install moviepy
```

---

# Usage
Grab the share link from your favorite youtube music video and place it line by line in links.txt

```
python main.py
```
The script will run and begin creating a folder and putting the youtube MP4's into that folder
then it will begin converting them into MP3's and putting those in a new folder
